Phase 1 (MVP, still “bank-correct”)
•	IAM + 2FA (TOTP + recovery codes)
•	Accounts + Ledger + Transfers (internal)
•	Transactions read model (basic)
•	Audit log pipeline
•	Employee portal basics + fraud alerts (rule-based)

Phase 2 (Scale + compliance polish)
•	OpenSearch transaction history + export
•	Admin case management + actions (freeze/holds)
•	Evidence collection endpoints for SOC2
•	WAF, bot defense, advanced rate limiting
•	Disaster recovery runbooks + restore tests

Phase 3 (Bank-grade expansion)
•	External payments rails integration
•	Risk scoring (velocity checks + device signals)
•	ML-assisted fraud triage
•	Multi-region readiness (active-active for read, controlled writes)
